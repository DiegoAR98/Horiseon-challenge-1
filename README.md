# Marketing Agency Website Accessibility

## Description

This repository contains the codebase for a marketing agency's website. The primary objective of this project is to ensure that the codebase adheres to accessibility standards, resulting in a website optimized for search engines. It achieves this by implementing semantic HTML elements, a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning, accessible alt attributes for images, sequential heading order, and a concise and descriptive title.
